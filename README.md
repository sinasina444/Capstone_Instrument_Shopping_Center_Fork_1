Project Name By Xiao Su: Online Instruments Sales Platform


The primary goal of this project is to build a fully functional shopping platform with a user-friendly front-end page that enhances the experience of ordering musical instruments. 
Through our platform, clients will be able to search for and buy instruments, while also gaining valuable knowledge related to music and instruments.

In addition, the website will build up a comprehensive backend management system that supports the full business order process, storage management, and a robust authentication system. 
Basic functionalities such as user registration and login will be implemented, along with a simulated payment system for a smooth purchasing experience.

Finally, the platform will provide customized services by analyzing usersâ€™ browsing and purchasing habits. 
Based on this data, we will offer personalized recommendations for specific instruments and related content, 
ensuring that users receive updated information and product suggestions that align with their interests and preferences.
